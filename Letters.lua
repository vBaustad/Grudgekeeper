-- Grudgekeeper - letters: news that waits until you open it.
-- Nothing pops up. A letter goes into your pile, the notice scroll (Notice.lua) shows that something
-- came, and clicking it opens the letter. Two sizes:
--   the SCROLL, unrolled between two rolls, for the orders themselves:
--     order     KILL ORDER       a guildie put a price on someone       red seal
--     complete  ORDER COMPLETE   an order was fulfilled                 red seal, FULFILLED stamp
--   the NOTE, a small landscape letter with a portrait, written by "the Grudgekeeper":
--     kill      A new title      a kill earned you one: where you stand  red seal
--     slain     Slain            someone killed you                     black seal, blood
--     paid      Bounty paid      the poster paid you                    red seal
--     expired   Order expired    your order ran out                     black seal
-- The paper, rolls, seals and blood are drawn by art/make_grudgekeeper_art.py (or imported from
-- generated art by art/import_grudgekeeper.py); the stamps by art/make_grudgekeeper_stamps.py.
