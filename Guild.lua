-- Grudgekeeper - the guild: leaderboard, kill orders, who is wanted, the feed.
-- Everyone sends only their OWN things: their score, their kills and deaths, the orders they posted,
-- the orders they fulfilled. Nobody can change another player's score or order. An order's
-- poster has the last word on it, and a guildie who was offline hears the poster's version next time.

-- another. A guildie who logged in on a second PC started there from 0, and that PC's first B wrote 0
-- over their row on every board; back on the first PC, its B wrote the old score back, and what the
-- second PC made was gone (Happy Idiot, 2026-11-11). So each PC keeps its own part of the score under a
-- mark of its own (GK.ClaimPC), and a B names every part its sender knows of:
--   mark:u:points:kills:deaths:assists:weekId:weekPoints:weekKills:weekDeaths:weekAssists, joined by ','
-- u is 1 for a part that holds the score from before marks existed. A part only grows, so two copies of
-- one join by taking the larger of each number, and a row is the sum of its parts - on a guildie's board,
-- and in the player's own record when the guild passes their row back after they log in. Whichever PC
-- spoke last, the sum is the same.
-- A row from before marks has no parts, and stays what it is until its owner's next B with parts, which
-- takes its place. It is never added to them.
--   Until 1.7.1 it was: kept as a part "?" - "it may be another PC's whole score" - until the parts
--   holding a score from before marks (u) added up to as much. But a row without parts is also what a
--   Grudgekeeper from before marks keeps of a guildie who HAS them: their B's plain numbers, every part
--   in one. When that guildie's own "?" could not be covered, each of us who updated turned such a sum
--   into a bigger "?", handed it back to them (R), their record grew by it (GK.MergeMine), and their next
--   B told everyone - who keep the larger of two copies. Umulius Kjakabråten, one PC, 24 kills: on the
--   owner's board 22 + 16 = 38 at 13:04 on 2026-11-13 and 38 + 16 = 54 at 16:51, 46 of them "this week",
--   his own part 16 throughout ("følte kanskje 46 kills var litt mye"). The second "?" was the whole of
--   the first row to the number, with no assists - as only a Grudgekeeper before 1.4.0 stores a row.
--   Nothing on a client can tell the two kinds of old row apart, and a part only grows, so "?" is gone:
--   not made, not read from a B or an R, and taken out of what was saved (GK.RetireOldRows). What it
--   was for - one PC still on a Grudgekeeper before 1.4.0 - mends itself when that PC is updated: its
--   record gets a mark, and the two add up. u still goes out with our part, for the clients that read it.
